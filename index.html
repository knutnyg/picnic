		<h2>How does it work?</h2>
		<p>Picnic determines your home country based on your phones configuration and location using your device's GPS. If you want to manually configure picnic with different countries than the ones detected, this can be done thought the wizard in the menu.
		</p>

		<p>Our data is based on public available information which provide no guarantee for correctness. Because of this, our currency rates should be used for informational purpose only. The currency rates provided by Picnic may vary from the ones provided by your bank.

		<h2>FAQ</h2>
		<p>
			<strike><b>Will there be offline support?</b></strike><br>
			Offline support is now available!</p>

		<p>
			<b>Can I have common currencies more readily available?</b><br>
			As of now, Picnic is structured around countries, and not currencies, making this hard to implement. However there might be room for this feature at a later time.
